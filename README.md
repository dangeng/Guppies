# Guppies!!!

Simulation of evolution I made Dec 2014. Uses nueral networks to control the x and y velocities of 'guppies' (really just white circles on a black screen). The parameters for each guppy's neural network is defined by the guppy's 'genes' (really just binary strings). Guppies that 'eat' the most food pellets go on to reproduce, essentially making new guppies by mixing and matching their 'genes' through a genetic algorithm.

Disclaimer: Made this junior year of high school, so there are quite a few not-so-kosher pieces of code in here.

There's a ton of things I want to do, such as adding a rock-paper-scissors kind of competition thing, or having guppy's be able to attack each other. I'll get to it when some free time opens up, which will hopefully happen before 2030 or something :)
